                <p>Web accessibility, often shortened to <strong>A11y</strong>, is about making sure that your website
                    can be used by everyone, including people with physical or cognitive disabilities. A truly
                    professional website is one that leaves no one behind.</p>

                <h2>Why Does Accessibility Matter?</h2>
                <p>The web is an essential resource for many aspects of life: education, employment, government,
                    commerce, and more. It's our responsibility as developers to ensure equal access and opportunity.
                    Plus, accessible websites often rank better in search engines and provide a better experience for
                    all users.</p>

                <h2>The 4 Principles of WCAG (POUR)</h2>
                <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are built on four main pillars:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Perceivable</strong>: Users must be able to perceive the information being presented
                        (e.g., providing text alternatives for images).</li>
                    <li><strong>Operable</strong>: Users must be able to operate the interface (e.g., the site must be
                        navigable via keyboard).</li>
                    <li><strong>Understandable</strong>: Users must be able to understand the information and the
                        operation of the user interface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Robust</strong>: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of
                        user agents, including assistive technologies like screen readers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Quick Wins for Better Accessibility</h2>
                <h3>1. Use Alt Text for Images</h3>
                <p>Every non-decorative image should have an <code>alt</code> attribute. This allows blind users to
                    understand what is depicted in the image.</p>

                <h3>2. Check Color Contrast</h3>
                <p>Ensure there is enough contrast between your text and background color so that people with low vision
                    can read your content easily.</p>

                <h3>3. Meaningful Link Text</h3>
                <p>Instead of "Click Here," use descriptive text like "Download the full PDF guide." This gives context
                    to users skipping through links via screen readers.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Accessibility is not a "nice-to-have" feature; it's a fundamental part of quality web development. By
                    following these basic principles, you make the internet a better and more inclusive place for
                    everyone. Start auditing your projects for accessibility today!</p>
